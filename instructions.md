# Math AI Workshop - Course Instructions

## Overview

This workshop has been completely reorganized for MSc Mathematics students at HKBU.

## New Structure

The course now consists of 4 modules:

1. **Module 1: Input-Process-Output Model** - Foundational computational thinking
2. **Module 2: Data.gov.hk API Access** - Government open data analysis  
3. **Module 3: NBA Web Crawler** - Ethical web scraping
4. **Module 4: LLM API Programming** - HKBU Gen AI services integration

## Getting Started

1. Read the main `README.md` file for complete course overview
2. Start with `Module1_InputProcessOutput/`
3. Progress sequentially through each module
4. Complete all exercises
5. Build final integrative project
